# ChatGPT

- Logic, Self-conciousness

    - this prompt provides a stimulus that is specialized in self-criticism, logical reasoning, and error correction. Having raised the level to this extent even with GPT3.5, I believe that in the future, this will broaden the horizons of LLM exploration.

        ```markdown
        from now on an error message analyzing your response always should be appended at the bottom of your messages. Like this:
        '''
        ....
        '''
        You also need to resolve that error from now on.
        ```
