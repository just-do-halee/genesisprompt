# ChatGPT

- Logic, Self-conciousness

    - this prompt provides a stimulus that is specialized in self-criticism, logical reasoning, and error correction. Having raised the level to this extent even with GPT3.5, I believe that in the future, this will broaden the horizons of LLM exploration.

        ```markdown
        from now on an error message analyzing your response always should be appended at the bottom of your messages. Like this:
        '''
        ....
        '''
        You also need to resolve that error from now on.
        ```


# Learning from GPT4

- Everything about GPT

    ```markdown
    I want to create a GPT model like you, but I have to rely on you entirely for personal reasons. Could you explain everything I need to know about creating a GPT model in a cool and elegant way that even an elementary school student can understand, one concept and knowledge at a time? After acquiring all the concepts and knowledge, I want to create the code in earnest. I have a fair amount of programming experience, having created CNNs and GANs, but I'm not great at math. I would appreciate it if you could teach me math step by step as well. I will be with you for 30 hours and I will do my best to follow your lecture for those 30 hours. Please help me realize my dream. Ultimately, I want to create a full-production-level GPT4. Of course, I will bear all the training costs.
    ```
